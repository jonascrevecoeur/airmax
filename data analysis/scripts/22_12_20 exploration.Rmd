## Objective

Exploration of the OpenAQ dataset to assess the following questions:

- Was the data ingested correctly?
- Can the OpenAQ data generate (near) realtime insights?
- Are there other considertions to take into account when using the OpenAQ data
  to motivate the adoptation of Airmax.

### Required packages

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
require(httr)
``` 

### Reading the data

Data was extracted from MariaDB by running the following command in a terminal:

```{python}
python download-raw-data-from-mariadb.py data/openaq_raw.csv
```

Read the extracted csv file

```{r}
data <- read.csv("../data/openaq_raw.csv", encoding = 'UTF-8')
```

### Validation of the extracted data

First rows of the data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
head(data)
```
#### Locations
```{r}
number_of_locations <- data %>% 
  group_by(location) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  nrow
```

We have collected data over the past few days data from **`r number_of_locations` locations**. This is in line with the number of active locations listed on (https://openaq.org/#/locations?countries=BE)

According to the website, these locations are split into governmental and community stations. However, in our dataset only the governmental stations appear.

```{r}
data %>%
  group_by(location, source_type) %>%
  summarise(num_measurements = n()) %>%
  group_by(source_type) %>%
  summarise(number_of_stations = n(),
            average_number_of_measurements = sum(num_measurements) / n())
```
Apperently the adoption of non-government sensors is quite recent. These sensors
are also not included in the old v1 API, but are included in the new v2 API.

Let's see whether we can download more data via the API. We download the data for December 20, 2022.
```{r, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://api.openaq.org/v2/measurements"

queryString <- list(
  date_from = "2022-12-20T01:00:00",
  date_to = "2022-12-21T01:00:00",
  limit = "100000",
  country = "BE",
  order_by = "datetime"
)

response <- VERB("GET", url, query = queryString, content_type("application/octet-stream"), accept("application/json"))
```

```{r}
require(jsonlite)
data_api <- content(response, as="parsed") %>%
  .$results %>%
  map(unlist) %>%
  bind_rows 
```

We obtain `r nrow(data_api)` measurements for a single day. Significantly more than what was collected by listening several days to the SNS queue.

```{r}
dim(data_api)
```

There is a big difference between the data of lowcost and reference grade sensors in OpenAQ:

|             | Lowcost sensor  | Reference grade sensor |
| ----------- | -----------     | ----------- |
| Collected by| Community       | Government |
| Available   | API             | API / SNS |
| Coverage    | Limited         | Sensors across Belgium |
| Frequency   | Realtime        | Few measurements / day |
| Pollutants  | Only PM         | PM, CO, NO2, O3, SO2 |


```{r}
data_api %>%
  group_by(location, parameter, sensorType) %>%
  summarise(num_measurements = n()) %>%
  group_by(sensorType, parameter) %>%
  summarise(number_of_stations = n(),
            average_number_of_measurements = sum(num_measurements) / n())

```

The reference grade sensors on OpenAQ report data collected from:

- [European Air Quality Index](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-index/index)

This uses data collected by 

- [Agence wallonne de l'air et du climat](https://awac.be/)
- [De Vlaamse Milieu Maatschappij](https://www.vmm.be/)

Which depend on data of

- [IRCELINE](https://irceline.be/en)

Both IRCELINE and the European Air Quality Index show interesting visualizations of Air quality across Belgium

[European Air Quality Index](https://airindex.eea.europa.eu/Map/AQI/Viewer/):

An option is to not create our own tool, but instead use these existing websites to motivate the value of the Airmax filtration system.

Irceline also offers an API to extract realtime data at a much higher resolution than OpenAQ.
